"""Inventory file parsers - CSV and XLSX.

Master Spec §15 Phase 3: "Capability list ingest (Excel upload + AI
extraction with redaction)". This module turns the raw artifact bytes
into a row-shaped representation the LLM can reason about. The LLM does
the column-mapping; we just give it well-shaped rows.

Phase 3 only supports CSV + XLSX. PDF ingest is a Phase 6 hardening
target (table extraction is a different problem and the inventory
documents Eugene's customers ship are reliably tabular).
